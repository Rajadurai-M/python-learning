Day 2:
Python syntax

Python indentation:
		Indentation means the spaces at the beggining of the code 
		Where in Other programming languages indetdation used for only the readability but python its very important 
		Indentation used for indicate block of code
		
		Python gives a error if you miss the indentation 
		As a programmer you use four space
		Follow the same space indentation for the block otherwise python through the error message 
statement:
	A computer program is a list of instruction to be executed by computer
	In programming language , these programming instructions are called statements,
	ex: print() - Its used to print the values 
	python have more statements 
	Python execution is followed by line by line 
Semi colons are optional rarely used 
	But however if the same line two statements are mentioned seperator (;) semicolon is needed 

print() is a build in function 
To print text :

To print a text in python must inside the quotes. we can use either double quotes "" or single quotes'' 
end parameter :(end="")
		In python end parameter used to print same line your text 
		we add a space after end=" " for better readability.
To print numbers :
	To display the number we dont need to put inside the quotes 
	We can do simple maths use print() function

Python commends :
	comments can be used to make the code more readable
	comments can be used to explain the code
	comments can be used to prevent execution while testing 

Python variables :
		variables are containers to store the data values.
		In python dont need to declare the varibles 
		Variable names are casesensitives

type () function 
		To identify the data type of values
casting:
	To change the data type of values
